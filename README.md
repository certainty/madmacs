> This is my Emacs configuration. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Madmacs in a few bullet points 
* Work in progress
  * build by me for me
  * not a framework but feel free to take it as a start for your own version
* Built on the shoulders of giants
  * many parts are based on other configurations like doom, lambda-emacs, centaur-emacs, etc.
  * it's slightly nuts that we have to go to that length to configure our editor 
* Optimized for software engineers
  * I use this as my daily driver 
* Configuration in plain emacs lisp
  * `use-package` with straight
  * simple boot approach that's easy to follow and modify
* Evil emacs (I just can't get out of modal editing) 
  * Consistent keybinding scheme using `SPC` as prefix
  * `,` is mode specific prefix
* Useful power-ups
  * Avy + Embark
  * Hydras
  * Vetico + Corfu + Marginalia & the gang 
* Fairly fast startup
  * I don't obsess over it. I don't know about you, but I do not restart my emacs all the time.
  

## Usage 

1. clone the repository to ~/.config/emacs
2. run `make deps`
3. start emacs 

## Keybindings

The global keybinds are available in the leader map via `SPC`.
Mode specific leader bindings are available (if they exist) under the local leader `,`.
